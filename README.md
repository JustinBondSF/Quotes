# Quotes
A webscraping python widget displaying quotes of a user selected topic. Very bare at the moment, first ever project. The linux program 'Variety' has a couple of plugins to display quotes that change on a timer, but with a limited number sources to draw quotes from. I wanted to take the quotes aspect of Variety and implement it in a portable way. Things on the todo list: Add a timer; polish the window to be titleless, transparent, configurable, and operated solely operable terminal commands and a right click menu (the buttons on the window now are just placeholders); implement more sources to scrape quotes from, as of right now it only supports brainyquote.com (perhaps implement a plugin system like Variety has for more quote sources?), please remember this is my first actually 'working' application, so right now I'm still just excited that the next and previous buttons work (though not completely as I would like still :/).
